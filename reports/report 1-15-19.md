### 1. What is the class imbalance in numbers? 





### 2. Please create two baselines as controls. 

The first will just assume that the lactose content in any sample is the mean (or median if you have wild outliers). The second first classifies to none or some and then take the mean as the predicted lactose level. How much better the model is with respect to those baselines? 

### 3. R^2 of 0.38 is quite low. What is your SRC and Mutual Information (MI) here? 



### 4. Any pre-processing steps (outliers, normalization, etc.)?



### 5. Visualize the samples with PCA/t-SNE and see if they cluster. Do you get the same weights with PCA on the features as with LASSO?
